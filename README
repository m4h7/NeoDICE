==== NeoDICE ====

NeoDICE is an attempt to clean up the source for the 68k/Amiga C compiler DICE. The main objective is to get it up and running on a modern Linux/Unix machine and compile c-code that targets the older Amiga computers (500, 600, 1000, 1200).

Modification of the original source code will be kept minimal.
